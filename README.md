# Exercise

I got a phone interview and got this question: Assuming you inset coins to a vending machine, and it returns as less as coins to you,
how to write a program? (Ex: 37 dollars inserted to machine, as return you'll get 3 of 10 dollar, 1 of 5 dollar, 2 of 1 dollar.)

There's 50 dollar, 10 dollar, 5 dollar and 1 dollar.
